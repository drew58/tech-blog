   <h1 className='h1'>Brief introduction to blockchain technology</h1>
   <h2>What is blockchain technology?</h2>

<p>Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions. <br/>
 It is a powerful tool that can be used to revolutionize many industries,<br/>
  from finance to healthcare to supply chain management.
A blockchain is a chain of blocks, each of which contains a record of transactions.<br/>
 The blocks are linked together using cryptography, which makes it very difficult to tamper <br/>
  with the data. This makes blockchain a very secure way to store data.</p>
<h2>How does blockchain work</h2>
<p>Blockchain works by using a distributed network of computers to store and verify transactions. <br/>
 This means that there is no central authority that controls the blockchain. Instead, the network of computers <br/>
  collectively maintains the blockchain.
When a transaction is made, it is added to a block. The block is then encrypted and linked to the previous <br/>
 block in the chain. This creates a chain of blocks, each of which contains a record of the transactions <br/>
  that have taken place.
The blockchain is constantly being updated with new blocks. This means that the data on the blockchain is <br/>
 always up-to-date and cannot be tampered with.</p>

<h2>What are the benefits of blockchain technology?</h2>

<p>There are many benefits to using blockchain technology. Some of the benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security: Blockchain is a very secure way to store data. The data on the blockchain is encrypted <br/>
 and linked together using cryptography, which makes it very difficult to tamper with.</li>
<li>Transparency: The blockchain is a transparent system. Anyone can view the transactions <br/>
 that have taken place on the blockchain. This makes it a very transparent way to store data.</li>
<li>Immutability: The data on the blockchain is immutable. This means that it cannot be changed or deleted. <br/>
 This makes it a very reliable way to store data.</li>
<li>Efficiency: Blockchain can be used to create more efficient systems. For example, <br/>
 blockchain can be used to create more efficient supply chain management systems.</li>
